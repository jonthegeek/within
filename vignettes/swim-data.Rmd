We collect reports from people who went for a swim by asking this question:

> Where did you swim and how hot was it outside?

The data usually comes as a CSV file, which we read into a data frame.

```{r clean-data}
infile <- "swim.csv"
original_dat <- readr::read_csv(
  infile,
  col_types = readr::cols(name = "c", where = "c", temp = "d")
)

dat <- original_dat %>% 
  localize_beach() %>% 
  celsify_temp()

dat
```

And then we write the data to a standard filename.

```{r write-data}
now <- Sys.time()
timestamp <- format(now, "%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")
cleaned_path <- sub("(.*)([.]csv$)", "\\1_clean\\2", infile)
outfile <- paste0(
  timestamp,
  "_",
  cleaned_path
)
readr::write_csv(dat, outfile)

```
